Project Idea: Task Management Application
------------------------------------------
Description: Build a Task Management application where Dart (using Flutter) serves as the front-end and Python serves as the back-end. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. The Python back-end handles data storage and retrieval, while the Dart front-end provides an interactive user interface.

Components:
------------
Front-End (Dart with Flutter):
------------------------------


User Interface: Create a Flutter app with pages for listing tasks, adding new tasks, editing existing tasks, and viewing task details.
HTTP Requests: Use the http package to make requests to the Python back-end for task management operations.
State Management: Manage the state of tasks using Flutter's state management solutions (e.g., Provider or Riverpod).

Back-End (Python with Flask):
-------------------------------

REST API: Develop a RESTful API with Flask that allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
Data Storage: Use a simple file-based storage system (e.g., JSON file) or a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) to store task data.
Endpoints: Implement endpoints for listing tasks, adding new tasks, updating tasks, and deleting tasks.
