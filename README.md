Project Idea: Task Management Application
------------------------------------------
Description: Build a Task Management application where Dart (using Flutter) serves as the front-end and Python serves as the back-end. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. The Python back-end handles data storage and retrieval, while the Dart front-end provides an interactive user interface.

Components:
------------
Front-End (Dart with Flutter):
------------------------------


User Interface: Create a Flutter app with pages for listing tasks, adding new tasks, editing existing tasks, and viewing task details.
HTTP Requests: Use the http package to make requests to the Python back-end for task management operations.
State Management: Manage the state of tasks using Flutter's state management solutions (e.g., Provider or Riverpod).

Back-End (Python with Flask):
-------------------------------

REST API: Develop a RESTful API with Flask that allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
Data Storage: Use a simple file-based storage system (e.g., JSON file) or a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) to store task data.
Endpoints: Implement endpoints for listing tasks, adding new tasks, updating tasks, and deleting tasks.

Features to Implement:
------------------------
Task Addition: Add a form to allow users to input new tasks.

Task Editing: Implement a way to edit existing tasks.

Improved UI: Add more styling and responsiveness to the Flutter app.

Error Handling: Enhance error handling and user feedback.

This project provides a solid foundation for working with Dart and Python together. 

You can expand it with additional features, such as user authentication or more complex task attributes, to increase its complexity and learn more about integrating these technologies.
