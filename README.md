Project Idea: Task Management Application
Description: Build a Task Management application where Dart (using Flutter) serves as the front-end and Python serves as the back-end. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. The Python back-end handles data storage and retrieval, while the Dart front-end provides an interactive user interface.
